Dotfiles
========

These are some of my dotfiles.

**alacritty** - [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) is a GPU accelerated terminal emulator.

**fish** - [Fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) shell. The best shell in the universe.

**nvim/init.vim** - [NeoVim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) configuration. Very similar to the vim configuration.

**gdb/.gdbinit** - Taken from [here](https://github.com/cyrus-and/gdb-dashboard) to give a nice VTE GUI display for GNU Debugger.

**sway** - [Sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway) is a tiling Wayland compositor. I don't really use this anymore since Gnome is nice.

**vim/.vimrc** - Vim configuration. I use the [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) plugin manager.

**wt (Windows Terminal)** - [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) configuration. A good start but subject to self edits.

**zathura** - [Zathura](https://github.com/pwmt/zathura) reader configuration.
