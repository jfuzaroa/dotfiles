Dotfiles
========

These are some of my dotfiles. I'll add to it as time goes on.

**blackmesa** - Zsh theme (oh-my-zsh) which is a copy of robbyrussel except with a lambda instead of an arrow on the left.

**gdbinit** - Taken from [here](https://github.com/cyrus-and/gdb-dashboard) to give a nice GUI like display for gdb.

**guake_colors** - Color palette I use for guake (I no longer use guake).

**i3status** - i3 status bar configuration.

**sway** - Sway configuration (Sway is an i3wm compatible Wayland compositor).

**termite** - Termite terminal emulator configuration.

**vimrc** - Vim configuration. I use the [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) plugin manager.

**zathura** - Zathura reader configuration.

**zshrc** - Z shell configuration along with the [oh.my.zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) framework.
